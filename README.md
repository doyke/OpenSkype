OpenSkype
=========

Welcome to OpenSkype!

In this project we are analyzing the Skype client's capabilities,

in order to enable other VoIP clients
to interoperate with (make calls to) Skype.

We are not developing a VoIP client here,

but we hope, that other projects, like Ekiga or Linphone,
will learn from or use our code.
